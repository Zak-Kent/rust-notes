** Layout of trees using Rowan

*** Three layers of a syntax tree
    - GreenNodes: Rowan concept, a tree of the input data with all whitespace
      preserved. This is the only place where data lives all the other
      structures point into the Green tree.
    - SyntaxNodes (Red nodes): Nodes that hold the semantic structure of the
      language, these are also defined in Rowan. You use these Red trees to
      access the information in like you would in another parser and then point
      into the green tree.
    - AST: Not sure of the distinction between the AST and the Syntax Nodes
